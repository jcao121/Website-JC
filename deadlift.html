    <h1>Deadlift</h1>
    <hr>
    <img src="images/deadlift.gif" alt="deadlift_gif">
    <p>The deadlift uses the hamstrings (back of thigh), quadriceps (front of thigh), gluteals (butt), and lower back muscles (erector spinae). The stabilizer muscles of core, abs, shoulders, and upper back also come into play. It is highly regarded for building muscle mass, which is desirable not just for bodybuilders, but also for people who want to boost their metabolism or prevent muscle loss due to aging. You can use the deadlift to build overall strength as well as core strength and stability. The deadlift is one of the best exercises for mimicking the lifting you do throughout the day, so it is a functional exercise. Learning to deadlift with good form, you will be able to lift and carry items with less risk in daily life.</p>

    <h1>Sumo Deadlift </h1>
    <img src="images/sumodeadlift.gif" alt="sumo_deadlift">
    <p>The sumo deadlift is a variation that uses a broader foot stance, similar to how a sumo wrestler sets up before a match. This version of a deadlift is often less demanding on the lower back and spine while still providing challenges for the same muscle groups.</p>
